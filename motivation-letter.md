Dear Dr Urbanek,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "Converting LaTeX Legacy R Journal Articles into R Markdown Articles using texor and rebib" for possible publication in the R Journal. 

It documents the packages, `texor` and `rebib`, that can be used to convert Latex formatted legacy articles into R Markdown to produce an HTML version. We developed this software and have used used it to convert all of the currently published R Journal articles.

We think that the paper will be of interest to the R Journal readers.
