# Introduction

The R Journal is the primary open-access outlet for the R community. In 2019, with the help of funding from the R Consortium it was decided that it was time to update operations. One aspect of this was to change from LaTeX paper submissions to a more reproducible format, where code was embedded in the document, and the output could be both HTML and pdf. 

There are numerous benefits of HTML format: 

1. Articles can include interactive graphics and tables.
2. The format is more accessible to screen readers making the work more accessible to vision impaired researchers.

<!-- traditional HTML is the most universally accessible format - Australian Human Rights Commission https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/disability-rights/world-wide-web-access-disability-discrimination-act-advisory-notes-ver and https://printdisability.org -->

Describe changes in templates, and web site. Desirability to convert the legacy articles. Decided to convert latex input to Rmd, rather than directly html and why.

# Background


### Pandoc Usage

Pandoc is a versatile document conversion program written in Haskell that is core
to numerous documentation systems, including Rmarkdown and Quarto. Pandoc first 
converts a document into an abstract syntax tree. From this, it can convert to a
different format, including custom ones. Although creating bespoke writers/readers
in Lua can be challenging, pandoc includes filters that allow users to customise 
the output generated based on matching patterns plus some logic to modify them. 

The Texor package uses these filters heavily, even for simple tasks like choosing
which supporting figures to copy. A lua filter constructs a list of image paths, 
writes it to an intermediate file and feeds them to the Texor package.


This was one of the earliest and most basic Lua filters, and it was part of the 
texor package:

```Lua
function Div(el)
    if el.classes[1] == 'thebibliography' then
        return { }
    end
end
```

Above filter reads the abstract syntax tree and filters out all the Div elements.
Then it looks for the class "thebibliography." It turns out that this Div element 
contains the LaTeX bibliographic records, which usually appear at the very end 
of papers. We don't need this portion in the article with the "RJ-web-article" 
layout,  given its inclusion as meta-data in the footer.
